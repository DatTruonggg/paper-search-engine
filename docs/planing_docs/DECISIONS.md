# Architectural Decisions (ADRs)

## ADR-001: Retrieval Strategy

- Decision: fast (single pass) and diligent (â‰¤3 refinements) for both search and chat.
- Rationale: Covers latency vs. quality trade-off.
- Status: Accepted.

## ADR-003: Storage Layout
- Decision: MinIO for artifacts, Postgres for metadata, ES for text + vectors.
- Rationale: Clear separation of concerns; scalable.
- Status: Accepted.

## ADR-004: Parsing
- Decision: GROBID primary; fallback to Unstructured for robustness.
- Rationale: Quality + resilience to parser failures.
