# Asta Agent Search & Agent Chat — Planning Docs

This folder contains the concise planning documents for implementing Agent Search (PaperFinder-lite) and Agent Chat (ScholarQA-lite) aligned with our existing stack (FastAPI, Elasticsearch, Postgres, MinIO, Next.js).

## Contents
- ARCHITECTURE.md — system components and data stores
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md — two-week plan and deliverables
- API_SPEC.md — endpoint contracts and examples
- GANTT.md — mermaid Gantt timeline
- WORKFLOW.md — mermaid diagrams for search, chat, ingestion
- DECISIONS.md — architectural choices and trade-offs
- REFERENCES.md — upstream inspirations and links

## Notes
- Keep it simple and SOLID; only logic comments allowed in code.
- Modes: fast (single pass) and diligent (short refinement).
