## Executive Summary

This report documents the successful implementation of advanced features for the ScholarQA system, including LLM-based query routing, early outline drafting, and real-time progress tracking. The system now intelligently classifies queries as "SIMPLE" or "STRUCTURED" and provides comprehensive, well-organized answers with live progress updates.

### 2. Early Outline Drafting
- **Implementation**: Pre-clustering outline generation
- **Features**:
  - Generates section structure before quote clustering
  - Guides subsequent clustering and summary generation
  - Improves answer coherence and organization
- **Impact**: More structured, comprehensive answers

### 3. Real-Time Progress Tracking

## Issues Identified & Resolved

### 1. **Hydration Error (RESOLVED)**
- **Issue**: Next.js hydration mismatch in progress tracker
- **Root Cause**: Unsupported CSS classes and conditional rendering
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed unsupported `animate-in` classes
  - Added mounted state check
  - Used standard Tailwind animations only
- **Status**: Fixed

### 2. **Backend Streaming Error (RESOLVED)**
- **Issue**: `NameError: name 'sections' is not defined`
- **Root Cause**: Undefined variable in progress callback
- **Solution**: Removed undefined `sections` parameter
- **Status**: Fixed

### 3. **JSON Parsing Issues (RESOLVED)**
- **Issue**: Failed to parse `CompletionCost` objects
- **Root Cause**: Missing object type handling
- **Solution**: Enhanced `safe_json_parse` to handle `CompletionCost`
- **Status**: Fixed

### 4. **Router Classification Issues (RESOLVED)**
- **Issue**: Complex queries incorrectly classified as "SIMPLE"
- **Root Cause**: Conservative LLM classification
- **Solution**: Added heuristics for automatic "STRUCTURED" detection
- **Status**: Fixed
